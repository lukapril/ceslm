        <h3><span style="color: #a63541">About CESLM</span></h3>
        <p>Cooperative ESL Ministries&nbsp;(CESLM) is a group of local Calgary residents who have come together to fill a gap that we have seen in society's integration of the immigrant, refugee, and international community who have come to Calgary. We believe that ordinary, open-hearted Calgarians, with training in cross-cultural communication and good principles of adult education for language learners, can make a difference.</p>
        
        <h3><span style="color: #a63541">CESLM's&nbsp;Vision</span></h3>
        <p>Churches as societies' leaders, welcoming and integrating newcomers to Canada.</p>
        
        <h3><span style="color: #a63541">CESLM's Mission</span></h3>
        <p>Empowering churches to reach out in love to immigrants and internationals in our communities.</p>
        
        <h3><span style="color: #a63541">What We Do </span></h3>
        <p>Cooperative ESL&nbsp;Ministries&nbsp;(CESLM) has three main objectives:</p>
        
        <h4><span style="color: #a63541">1. Support Church-Based ESL&nbsp;Ministries </span></h4>
        <p>CESLM&nbsp;offers conferences, workshops, and training sessions to current and prospective ESL teachers, directors, administrators, conversation partners, home-stay parents, and other volunteers involved in welcoming and integrating newcomers into Calgary<span style="display: none">&nbsp;</span>. We also provide forums for churches, ESL teachers and volunteers to network with one another.</p>
        <h4><span style="color: #a63541">2. Advocate on Behalf of Canada's Newcomers </span></h4>
        <p>CESLM does consciousness-raising among faith groups in Calgary, encouraging openness and involvement and reducing barriers. This involves audio-visuals, print materials, and presentations to various community groups.</p>
        
        <h4><span style="color: #a63541">3. Act as a Referral Agent to Other Service Providers </span></h4>
        <p>CESLM provides referrals to specialized services for Newcomers such as employment training/services, settlement/housing issues, medical and life skills, citizenship, further academic training, English for professionals, et cetera.</p>
