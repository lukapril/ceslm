                       "description":"Treacherous Heart is a story about forgiveness, the power of love and the redeeming grace of God. It is an inspirational feature film about a young Nigerian-Canadian woman in her mid-twenties, fighting against obstacles like an arranged marriage and inter-ethnic relationships. After falling in love, she is forced into an arranged marriage and must choose between her roots and her heart. She finds out quickly enough that growing up in Canada does not exclude her from being caught in Nigerian social taboos. Treacherous Heart highlights issues of culture clash between immigrant children and their Canadian children.",
